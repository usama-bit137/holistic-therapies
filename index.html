        <div class="about-text">
        Holistic Therapies by Iram we provide a range of complimentary treatments for a variety of health conditions. These treatments are an excellent way to improve your general wellbeing. 
        The treatments available are:
        
        <ul>
        <li> Reflexology is a non-intrusive Chinese complementary health therapy based on the theory that different points on the feet, lower legs, hands, face or ears correspond with different areas of the body.</li>
        <li> Reiki is a form of Japanese complimentary therapy related to energy healing. This works with the energy fields around the body and involves the transfer of universal energy from the practitioner’s palms to the client.</li>
        <li>Pre-natal and Post-natal massage can help by relieving back strain, headaches and ease post-partum stress. There are pre-natal guidelines that a massage therapist should follow. Pre-natal massage has many benefits such as hormone regulation, reduce swelling and improvement of nerve pain. Post-partum massage helps mothers after delivery to restore their body and ease post-partum depression.</li>
        <li> Hot and cold stones have been used for centuries to address the many levels of healing necessary to help restore balance in the ‘mind, body and soul’. The stones work by warming and cooling muscular areas, resulting in faster relaxation and expulsion of toxins.</li>
        <li> Indian Head Massage is a treatment that focuses on acupressure points along the head, neck and shoulders often using circular massage strokes to improve hair and scalp conditions. It originates from an Indian alternative system of medicine called Ayurveda.</li>
        <li> Deep Tissue Massage centres on realigning the deeper layers of connective and muscle tissue. It aims to release the chronic patterns of tension in the body through slow strokes and deep finger pressure on the tense areas, either following or going across the fibres of the muscles, tendons and fascia.</li>
        <li> Swedish massage is the manipulation of the soft tissue for therapeutic purposes. The different movements used either on their own, or in combination affect the skin, muscles, blood vessels, lymphatic system, nerves and some internal organs.</li>
        <li> Holistic Facial can help reduce stress headaches and muscle tension in the head,  face, neck, shoulders and throughout the body. It also helps to soften facial lines and decreases wrinkles.
        </ul>

        Iram has two decades of expertise in treating chronic illnesses using holistic therapies.
